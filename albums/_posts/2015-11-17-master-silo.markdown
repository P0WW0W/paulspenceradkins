My master's thesis, completed for Aalto University, makes a case for the preservation of the Munkkisaari State Granary. The historic 1950's grain silo is located in a downtown Helsinki brown zone. The area is slated for conversion into a residential zone according to recently drafted master plans. Through collaboration with the Helsinki City Planning Department and industry leading engineers, I propose that the state owned building should be converted into a warehouse scale data center. Drawing from innovative technologies developed in Helsinki for nordic data centers, the proposed building would make use of nearly all waste heat from the servers to warm the 5,000 neighboring residences of the peninsula, capitalizing on local high capacity electrical infrastructure and state of the art district cooling practices.
