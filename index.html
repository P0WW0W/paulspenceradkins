    "Adkins has an effortless voice and a very natural stage presence..."

    "Adkins has an incomparable voice.
    The man has got a very special special tenor sound and acting skills to match.
    He makes you believe anew in the wondrous and wonderful transformative powers of love"

    "...Armed with instincts of a showman, tenor Paul Spencer Adkins gave a breezy

    Adkins produced his best work in the superb concluding medley of spirituals.
    These were strongly characterized, deeply felt renditions, a near-ideal combination
    of ringing opertic timber and idiomatic note-bending..."
