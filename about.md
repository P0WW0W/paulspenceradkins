  Over the last 6 years I've worked in Philadelphia, Melbourne and Helsinki as an architect and web-developer. I'm new to New York City, and loving every day here. I enjoy coffee in the morning, gardening in the summer, and music with soul always. 

  I'm regularly listening for exciting projects, collaboration, and new ideas.
