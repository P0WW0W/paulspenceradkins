        "Paul is a wonderful voice teacher, mentor and friend.
        I had the good fortune of studying with him, where I learned the foundations of vocal technique,
        a sense of professionalism, and the art of storytelling through song.
        He provided me with countless opportunities outside of our voice lessons to grow as an artist and young man.
        He helps facilitate connections between his students and working artists,
        creates opportunities for them to perform in countless professional settings,
        and fosters a wonderful community of young performers where his students find a haven and home.
        I feel so lucky to have been his student and can't praise him often or loudly enough."

        "Mr. Paul Spencer Adkins changed my life. I came to him for voice lessons at age 15
        when I was considering auditioning for collegiate theatre programs.
        It was in his studio that I not only learned healthy technique, but I also learned to love singing more than I ever thought I could.
        Mr. Adkins is gifted with the ability to meet you where you are, on your vocal path as well as your path in life.
        He encouraged me, challenged me, sharpened me, guided me with a steady wisdom and intricate understanding of the voice as well as the soul behind it.
        I was greeted each week with a warm smile and kind words.
        Mr. Adkins has the unique gift to create an atmosphere that fosters creativity, focus and growth.
        His teaching was always clear, understandable and tailored exactly to me.
        He knows how to steer you away from bad habits and guide you to the healthiest place for creating vocal sensations.
        (It also really helps that he is an EXTRAORDINARY vocalist, an excellent musician and artist.
        His example gave me something wonderful to aspire to.)
        It is because of him that I had the confidence to audition for my dream school, Carnegie Mellon University.
        With his coaching, help with song selection, vocal guidance and his belief in me, I was able to give a great audition and ended up being accepted to CMU.
        I will always treasure my years in Mr. Adkins’ studio.
        He changed my life, as we say in WICKED, “for good”."
