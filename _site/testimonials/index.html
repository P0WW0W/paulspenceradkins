        “My formative years under the tutelage of Paul was not only where I learned a solid foundation of Bel Canto singing, 
		but where I was allowed personal growth and room for exploration of what I had to offer through my voice. 
		Paul's passion for singing is apparent in each lesson through his care and specific attention to each student and their unique voice. 
		The joy and exuberance he displays when teaching and propelling each singer to their utmost potential is tangible, 
		and is certainly what makes them yearn for even more growth. 
		Paul is the most careful, nurturing, knowledgeable teacher that one could have the pleasure to work with. 
		You will walk away with a song in your heart, but more importantly, a reason to sing it.”

        “One aspect of my singing on which I still regularly receive compliments is the soundness of my technique.
        I gratefully credit my studying with Paul for laying that solid vocal foundation.
        Paul has an excellent ability to help a singer eliminate unnecessary and unhelpful vocal habits,
        while leading the singer to find the strong core of his or her unique instrument.
        I have always found Paul to have boundless and infectious positive energy.
        He shares genuine joy with each step forward, large or small.
        The singer leaves the lesson exhilarated and enthusiastic to do more work.
        I wholeheartedly recommend Paul as a teacher for vocal students of all ages and experience levels.”

        "Mr. Paul Spencer Adkins changed my life. I came to him for voice lessons at age 15
        when I was considering auditioning for collegiate theatre programs.
        It was in his studio that I not only learned healthy technique, but I also learned to love singing more than I ever thought I could.
        Mr. Adkins is gifted with the ability to meet you where you are, on your vocal path as well as your path in life.
        He encouraged me, challenged me, sharpened me, guided me with a steady wisdom and intricate understanding of the voice as well as the soul behind it.
        I was greeted each week with a warm smile and kind words.
        Mr. Adkins has the unique gift to create an atmosphere that fosters creativity, focus and growth.
        His teaching was always clear, understandable and tailored exactly to me.
        He knows how to steer you away from bad habits and guide you to the healthiest place for creating vocal sensations.
        (It also really helps that he is an EXTRAORDINARY vocalist, an excellent musician and artist.
        His example gave me something wonderful to aspire to.)
        It is because of him that I had the confidence to audition for my dream school, Carnegie Mellon University.
        With his coaching, help with song selection, vocal guidance and his belief in me, I was able to give a great audition and ended up being accepted to CMU.
        I will always treasure my years in Mr. Adkins’ studio.
        He changed my life, as we say in WICKED, “for good”."
